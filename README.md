# Task management dashboard 
App to create tasks in a clear dashboard.
The app is organized into two routes, home, and edit.
On the home page, you can see your tasks, and create a new one.



## Create task
Every task has a `title`, a `description`, and a `due date`.
Is it possible also to set a task `pinned`, `done`, or delete it.

## Filter task
The filter toolbar works filtering by title, done, todo, pinned task, and sort it. All the filters are synced into the URL, so if the page is refreshed, the filters will be applied to the app.
